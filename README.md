Approximately clockwise from bottom left:
* Enclosure with cable glands, battery holder, and [Margay data logger](https://github.com/NorthernWidget/Project-Margay/)
* Hose clamps (4)
* 90-degree bends of 3/4" EMT conduit (x2)
* Conduit compression connector
* Cable ties (black for UV resistance)
* Conduit compression adapter (pictured inverted from attachment direction)
* 3/4" NPSM straight connector
* MaxBotix ultrasonic rangefinder (here we assume that it will communicate with the data logger via its UART interface)
* 4-conductor cable (3-conductor also works, but is not as often sold)
* Telaire T9602 temperature and relative-humidity sensor
* Solar radiation shield

*Detailed parts list with suppliers is available in the cited paper*

## Borehole (not pictured)

Use Kovacs ice augers to drill one or more ~5 cm holes in the glacier surface to an appropriate depth for your ablation-station mast and any supporting structure(s).

## Pole (not pictured)

Use one or more thick (e.g., Schedule-80) pieces of plastic pipe or other rigid material as the main mast and/or supporting structure. A single main mast may spin, so additional support is recommended.
